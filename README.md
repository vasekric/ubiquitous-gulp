## What is this repository for? ##
* Coding templates for further use in frameworks like Nette
* Write in Less instead of CSS
* Split styles you write into several Less files and then bundle all of them into one big file + minify it
* It watches your less files and bundle them with each change in order to keep your bundled css file in sync
* Adds browser specific properties into css, so you can write pure and nice css properties in you less files
* Provides small server with hot reload of html and css for faster development. When you make a change in files and save is, it will automatically bundle your files and swap them in your browser without any reload.
